A year ago I was a happy ActionScript 3 consultant, operating independently and remotely and working on complex and rewarding projects targeting Adobe&#39;s Flash runtime. Last December, though, <a href="http://skai.net">a client</a> invited me to join their company full-time and I decided to take the plunge.</p>
<p>This post is basically a recap of what technologies I&#39;ve been playing with in the past year.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>My first task was to come to grips with the fact that Flash no longer had a future in the mainstream. This is not really ambiguous - clients became reluctant to pay for Flash work, and I became reluctant to sell them on it. Flash still does and probably will for some time have some significant market share for games or video applications, but that&#39;s a niche field today and it&#39;s only going to shrink moving forward. So when I had an opportunity to learn some new skills while working with some brilliant people on an amazing technological innovation the path forward was clear.</p>
<p>Since my specialization had been front-end software engineering this left me with basically one alternative: it was time to finally bite the bullet and learn JavaScript. This prospect had been on my radar for a while by then, but I was afraid: I was afraid of language-specific functionality, like the lack of type safety; I was afraid of browser-compatibility hell, which Flash did so much to mitigate; mostly I was afraid of jumping out of my familiar environment and into something new - but wow am I glad I did!</p>
<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>
<p>Listen, if you&#39;re afraid of JavaScript then you need to embrace it head on. It&#39;s one thing not to like it because you&#39;re familiar with it and have deployed projects with it and you prefer something else (though, what else is there for front-end software development?) But, if you are scornful of the language because it&#39;s not what you&#39;re used to then take some time to consider this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://angularjs.org">angular.js</a> gives you tremendous client-side capability. They&#39;ve abstracted out all of the browser-based complexity for you so you don&#39;t even need to use jquery selectors anymore - they create a parallel stack that&#39;s tied to the DOM at every level, and with data-binding and event handling you can create highly dynamic, reactive software applications where the display updates automatically for you. Plus, you can even define your own HTML elements - <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/pwwjh/4/">check this out</a>!</li>
<li><a href="http://d3js.org">d3</a> is an awesome data visualization library. My first JavaScript project made heavy use of D3 animations and visualizations integrating with Google Maps, and while confusing at first I really came around to it.</li>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> lets you write really fast, powerful and flexible server-side applications in JavaScript. Couple this with <a href="http://expressjs.com">express.js</a> and you can spin up a complex web application in no time, complete with dynamic URL routing. You were, what, just figuring LAMP would get an overhaul eventually?</li>
<li><a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> is the icing on the cake - an abstraction layer wrapping several implementations of real-time communication, socket.io lets you easily share state between the browser and your node.js server. Create an object in node, use socket.io to send it down to the browser. Then let Angular render it. All automagic, all real-time. This is NOT your grandma&#39;s web stack.</li>
<li><a href="http://vowsjs.org">vows.js</a> gives you BDD in JavaScript. Great for testing your node.js applications, and flexible enough to support complex nested asynchronous operations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aws">AWS</h2>
<p>Further breaking with my front-end-consulting past, I discarded my policy of never touching anything that wasn&#39;t specifically front-end related. When you&#39;re consulting it can be generally helpful for everyone if you only touch the things they&#39;re paying you to touch. If you start helping with server config or file permissions and then something goes wrong, well, they may be tempted to blame you - so it&#39;s easiest just to focus on what you are specializing in.</p>
<p>But in a startup with three other programmers you don&#39;t always have that luxury. In order to deploy our technology we decided to roll out an implementation using Amazon Web Services. This is another one of those things that I had always been curious about but never really touched; well, those days of innocence are long behind me.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve never tried it, you may be shocked to learn how easy it is to set up a cheap, powerful web presence using AWS&#39;s out of the box tools. You handle DNS through their <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Route 53</a>, you spin up an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Elasitc Compute Cloud</a> instance to host your data, you make sure the right ports are open and bam, you&#39;re up and running! (incidentally, that&#39;s where I&#39;m hosting this blog right now).</p>
<p>In order to do these things, though, you have to get familiar with another tool that I&#39;d long put off mastering...</p>
<h2 id="the-command-line-is-your-friend-">The Command Line is your Friend!</h2>
<p>If you are like a lot of front-end devs you know how to &#39;cd&#39; into a directory and maybe how to view its contents. That was more or less the extent of my skill about a year ago. But since I was learning so many new things I decided to double-down on mastering my tools, and I&#39;m really glad I did. These days I feel more comfortable navigating around in the terminal window than I do using Finder, and I&#39;m not just saying that.</p>
<p>I am not going to dive here into an introduction to the command line (though that&#39;d probably be a good idea for a post!), but I do want to give any mac users out there one tip to make CLI interaction that much more powerful: do yourself a favor and download a program called <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm 2</a>. There&#39;s one specific feature that this program has which makes a world of difference. Install it, go into your preferences and do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the &#39;keys&#39; tab</li>
<li>In the bottom left, select both of the hotkey-related checkboxes. When you set your hot key, I recommend ⌘` - that&#39;s not the apostrophe, it&#39;s the accent mark that shares space with the ~ to the left of your &quot;1&quot; key.</li>
<li>Close preferences and press ⌘` - you should see a glorious command line interface unfold from the top of your screen. Press ⌘T - you have a new tab! Press escape, the whole thing goes away.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="java-dear-god-java-">Java. Dear God, Java.</h2>
<p>After months of unfettered frolicking in the type-free fields of JavaScript, reality gave me a sharp kick in the ass and I had to wrap my head around some enterprise Java code. Java is in many ways the complete antithesis to JavaScript - it&#39;s even stricter than AS3, which I&#39;m really appreciating in retrospect as a great language in spite of its shortcomings.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve got a lot of Java code and we wrangle it using IntelliJ Idea. I don&#39;t have too much to say about this, except that I&#39;ve come to feel really frustrated and uncomfortable about the strictness of Java&#39;s paradigms. It feels like every time I have an idea that would take 20 minutse in JavaScript I need to spend two days reading about mutually incompatible libraries that expose circularly dependent libraries that make what I want to do &#39;easy&#39; in Java. And everyone on the fora acts like this is some sort of golden age, because life before these libraries was some kind of hell!</p>
<p>I mean, I get it. I understand the problem that Java solves, and I understand that when you&#39;ve been the big dog for over a decade there are going to be a lot of version conflicts and incompatibilities and your new code is always going to have to support your legacy code and so everything gets bloated and -- ya know what? I just don&#39;t like it. I get that it&#39;s gotten us this far, in many ways, but it&#39;s not the sort of thing I want to spend my time working with any more than I have to.</p>
<p>It just feels like to really be good at Java you have to have been writing Java for at least 5 years, and you have to be engaged with the community and know the tips and tricks and undocumented design patterns and etc. Maybe every language feels like this to someone who doesn&#39;t know it, but I feel like Java is filled with tons and tons and tons of &#39;wrong ways&#39; to solve problems that will get you in trouble if you don&#39;t know about them.</p>
<h2 id="computer-science">Computer Science</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll wrap up with a quick bit about theory. In the past few weeks I&#39;ve learned enough Lisp to be able to follow some of the stuff in <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> and Holy Shit. Listen: if you&#39;re a thoughtful person who also happens to be a programmer, but you&#39;ve never looked into Lisp, well, this book is free and I can promise it&#39;ll be an eye opener. I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d ever actually build anything in Lisp, but reading about the recursions and clever data structures they&#39;re working with really opened my eyes to what&#39;s possible. It fills me with a sense that we haven&#39;t really even scratched the surface of what our technology can do for us - and we&#39;re all fighting about which language is better and what OS we like. These are just the distractions we have to live through, yeah?</p>
<p>I also recently received a crash course in the C programming language, learning about how memory pointers work and about how c structs work. It took about an hour to grok this stuff, and suddenly I understood conventions and limitations of programming languages that I&#39;ve been experiencing for years and never really thought much about other than &quot;oh well that&#39;s just the way that is, I guess.&quot; Understanding how C allocates memory, the difference between heap and stack and the way structs enable pointers and why that&#39;s a powerful thing - wow.</p>
<p>Pushing my boundaries like this, learning about the old ideas at the core of what I do every day, is humbling and exciting. It makes me realize just how deep the rabbit hole goes and just how fucking smart those guys in the 60s and 70s and 80s must have been.</p>
<h2 id="that-s-what-i-got">That&#39;s what I got</h2>
<p>So that&#39;s the past year in a nutshell. I&#39;ve learned so much and grown so much that I could stop learning and growing now and it would take me another year just to finish digesting. What I&#39;m really looking forward to is writing about what we&#39;ve been up to at my company - but that&#39;s going to have to wait just a little bit longer.</p>

Some new advances in our technology at work, though, are going to make it possible for me to write some very powerful, very low-level integration between hardware microcontrollers and our secret sauce.</p>

<p>The year hasn&#39;t been a total wash - I did get to play with some Arduino stuff while refreshing my knowledge of CSS. I have a video of a potentiometer controlling the 3D CSS properties of some web content, in realtime - that&#39;s pretty cool, right?</p>

<p>Look forward to more information about hardware hacking from me, especially as I get more involved in the local hacker community in DC.</p>

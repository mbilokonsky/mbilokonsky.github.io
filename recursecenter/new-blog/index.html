I&#39;ve been at <a href="http://recurse.com/" title="Recurse Center">Recurse Center</a> for the past month and have bounced around between various endeavors.
<!-- more --></p>
<p>So far I&#39;ve:</p>
<ul>
<li>taught a weekly javascript workshop covering topics like Webpack/Babel, React, DevTools, Node.js, etc.</li>
<li>learned a bit about machine learning (enough to know that it&#39;s not something I want to break into just yet),</li>
<li>spent some time trying to extend the javascript language (I want to add an <code>isolated</code> keyword which would allow you to assert that a function makes zero use of external state) by writing a babel plugin, but I found that you can&#39;t use babel for something like this because the underlying parser that babel uses (babylon) can&#39;t be extended without official support from the ECMAScript standards body</li>
<li>defined and spec&#39;d out a node.js tool for creating and hosting chat bots across a variety of services, only to learn that hubot has basically already implemented everything I was going to do. Whoops.</li>
<li>did some python, to extract colors from images (for use in a larger toolchain around video processing)</li>
<li>set up this blog, and</li>
<li>decided on how I want to spend the bulk of the rest of my time at RC: by writing a language.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the plan is to write a language that will compile into javascript, but with a very limited scope. This language (tentatively called &quot;reduxion&quot;) is for defining a redux store (with associated reducers, action creators, etc) in a concise and elegant way. It&#39;ll eliminate a lot of boilerplate redux code, but more importantly it&#39;ll teach me how to work with parsers and lexers and compilers and the whole thing from bottom to top.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve chosen to set up this blog using <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">metalsmith</a> in part because metalsmith is highly extensible, and it should be simple enough for me to create some interesting interactive posts to play with fun techniques. :)</p>

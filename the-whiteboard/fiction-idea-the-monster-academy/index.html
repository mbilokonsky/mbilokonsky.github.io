My own twist on the supernatual coming of age story, sort of.</p>

<p>Idea for fiction: in this shitty economy, a struggling young teacher has trouble finding work. Eventually hired by a private academy in a sparsely populated region of Montana. Turns out, though, that it&#39;s a MONSTER ACADEMY!</p>
<p>Kids are all various movie-monster spawn - first-grader ghost that wants to grow up to be a poltergeist, werewolves going through puberty, a self-absorbed but good-looking vampire repeating the 10th grade for the 87th time constantly trying to pick up vulnerable high school girls who are way over the whole vampire thing.</p>
<p>The class bully is the human son of a rich industrialist here because he has been expelled from all the other good schools for being such a little monster. etc.</p>
<p>Theme inverts while paraphrasing Harry Potter, because it&#39;s about a new teacher and not a new student. Kids enjoy it because not only does it have a unique take on classic monsters but also it humanizes grownups in a way that a lot of young adult fiction does not; but adults relate to it too because the main character isn&#39;t a whiny immature douchebag.</p>
<p>Various avenues to explore: what holidays are celebrated and how? Do little ghosts grow up to be adult ghosts? How is history class different? Science? Social Studies? Are there any other human teachers? How do human teachers relate to terrifying monsters who are young enough to be adorable? How do established monster tropes who have been eating teenagers for decades fair when they&#39;re going through their own adolescence? Is there an overarching fantasy plot? Does it need one? The big finale can be resolved at the annual monsters ball!</p>

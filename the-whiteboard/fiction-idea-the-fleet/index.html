<!-- more -->
<p>There&#39;s an enormous fleet of spaceships, ranging in size from fairly small (fits a few hundred thousand passengers) to fairly large planet-sized vessels. This fleet has been traveling between galaxies for a long time. So long, in fact, that nobody knows where it actually started or where it&#39;s going. So long that a lot of communications between vessels have broken down, some ships have failed entirely, and the whole thing is rather dilapidated with each ship more or less isolated from the others, with some exceptions.</p>
<p>The story opens on a ship that&#39;s filled with people living off the land - because there is land, nature, I mean this thing may as well be a planet. They don&#39;t even know they&#39;re on a ship - they live on the inside, let&#39;s say. We follow our protagonist as he one day finds a cave which takes him to the surface where he can see, for the first time, the stars - and some of the other ships.</p>
<p>The tone of this story will mimic escapist nautical adventure. He&#39;s going to go off on an adventure, travel between the different ships, make friends and enemies and sort of live the high life for a while. The nautical metaphor works pretty well, and I plan to play with it - maybe there&#39;s an enclave, maybe even a huge enclave, modeled on some imperialist european tradition. They control a thousand ships, see themselves as maintaining the last bastion of order against entropy. Maybe there&#39;s a &#39;here-there-be-dragons&#39; part of the fleet which nobody has mapped because something strange happens to any vessel that enters it. Most of the fleet (much of the fleet?) is simply composed of isolated &#39;islands&#39; - each ship, like the one we started on, self-contained with its own culture.</p>
<p>The reason I like this is because it can be used to frame literally any kind of story you can think of. I love, for instance, the idea of technology so old and so powerful that it&#39;s essentially worshipped as a magical deity. Maybe there&#39;s a ship where only a few people are still born with the proper genetically encoded computer interface in their brains which allows them to ask the computer to make it rain, etc. This framework could be used to recapitulate any period in history, any themes, any settings.</p>
<p>I still don&#39;t entirely know what the overarching story is - I think maybe there isn&#39;t one. I think maybe there are various groups who seem like they know what&#39;s &#39;really going on&#39;, but maybe they turn out to be just as in the dark as anyone else. Ultimately there are too many ships to count, and each ship has too many mysteries to even list. It&#39;s a celebration of the limits of human knowledge and of the mystery - the emptiness - at the core of everything.</p>
<p>Uncountable ships floating through the void, any meaning that may once have been there long since scrubbed away. Each ship alone, yet each ship within fairly easy reach of others. It&#39;s a fractal. When I am old and rich and have time for frivolous pursuits I would like to write many stories in this setting.</p>

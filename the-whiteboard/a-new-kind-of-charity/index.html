Some of them are happy there - but it&#39;s in a way really kind of shitty that a lot of the greatest minds of our time are working long hours to enrich private equity firms.</p>
<p>Imagine if Newton or Einstein or Da Vinci dedicated their energies to creating solutions so proprietary that even the problems they solve can&#39;t be specified to anyone not under NDA.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s anything wrong with using abilities to make money - but I think there might be a way to mitigate this financial sector brain drain for the benefit of humanity at large.</p>

<p>I think it would be interesting to create a charity whose focus is on the rehabilitation of these individuals through the assignment of challenging, meaningful work.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not about donating dollars to causes - it&#39;s about donating causes to geniuses, many of whom value a good problem more highly than they value a paycheck.</p>
<p>Maybe the best way to implement this charity is actually with a bit of technology. &quot;I need help solving X&quot; is not a useful request - but &quot;I need an algorithm such that given X it returns Y&quot; is.</p>
<p>This is a problem that has been solved, in programming. We call statements like the one above &#39;tests&#39;, and there are tons of testing frameworks for all sorts of different languages. One obstacle to overcome is that tests are themselves code - but that problem is actually going away, a bit, with the advent of new tools that enable non-programmers to define application requirements with natural language, which is then processed into unit tests.</p>
<p>For instance, why not implement this charity by taking a tool like <a href="http://cukes.info">Cucumber</a> and wrapping it in a web interface that allows individuals to generate test suites simply by defining their problem in a series of short, well-defined sentences?</p>
<p>What we&#39;d end up with is a publicly available list of test suites. These are concrete, actionable portfolios of incredibly well-defined problems. We could integrate everything with a public code repository (probably Github), so that any time someone wants to donate their abilities to solve a problem they can check out the test, write some code, and then commit their code.</p>
<p>I envision this working a bit like Stack Overflow, but instead of programmers asking programmers for help it would be non-programmers asking programmers to actually write code - but they would do it in an incredibly polite, easy-to-understand way by providing the unit tests.</p>
<p>[Edit: this idea has evolved a lot as I wrote it up - I think it&#39;s moving more towards, let&#39;s build a tool that let&#39;s people write unit tests so that if they want to request help from programmers they can do it in a way that makes it as easy as possible for the programmer.]</p>

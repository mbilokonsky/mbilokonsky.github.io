</div><ul><li><a href="/the-whiteboard/fiction-idea-the-monster-academy">Fiction Idea: The Monster Academy</a><span>- <p>A fictional setting that would, I think, be really fun to write. My own twist on the supernatual coming of age story, sort of.</p></span></li><li><a href="/the-whiteboard/fiction-idea-the-fleet">Fiction Idea: The Fleet</a><span>- <p>I&#39;ve had this idea floating around in my head for years, and would one day love to make a video game or fictional series set here.</p></span></li><li><a href="/the-whiteboard/a-new-kind-of-charity">A New Kind of Charity</a><span>- <p>A lot of really brilliant programmers, who could have done almost anything with their abilities, followed the siren song of the high paycheck into careers in finance.

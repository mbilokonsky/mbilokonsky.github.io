<p>On the surface, this is a tale about office politics in a police department where everyone is just angry at the additional paperwork. Digging a bit deeper you find the story of a lonely guy trying - trying really hard, and for the first time in years - to stop living exclusively in his head, to give a shit about other people. And if you really pay attention, you&#39;ll find that the value of this work - the real genius - has very little to do with the actual plot.</p>
<p>Warren Ellis&#39;s genius lies in the way he writes about time.</p>

<p>In Gun Machine, the present is treated as only incidentally privileged. Everything and everyone is written as existing in time.</p>
<p>Tallow&#39;s ill-fated partner meets his end when his knee gives out in a critical moment - but it&#39;s not merely that he had a bad knee, it&#39;s that he&#39;s been jogging a lot lately because his new wife is a nurse who is insisting that he get into better shape.</p>
<p>The slum lord who owns the apartment building where the action kicks off isn&#39;t merely out of shape - he&#39;s someone who was clearly once in peak physical condition, but who has let himself go, probably only in the past few years, and whose pants no longer fit quite right.</p>
<p>The receptionist at the financial company isn&#39;t incompetent - she&#39;s wearing long sleeves on a hot day and scratching absent-mindedly at her hair, which she clearly used to wear shaved, and which is growing in unevenly in a way that suggests she has a tattoo on her head, and presumably on her arms. Without ever explicitly mentioning it, Ellis perfectly conveys the sense that this is someone who is trying very, very hard to go straight after living on the edge, and who isn&#39;t sure if she will make it.</p>
<p>In one scene, the murderer hides in the shadows cast by the doorway to an abandoned building - but it&#39;s not merely an abandoned building, it&#39;s a Christian bookstore that clearly couldn&#39;t find a market in this part of town and had to close some years ago. The property hasn&#39;t been repurposed because it&#39;s in a shitty part of town that will probably be torn down for new development soon and any investment in the buildings there runs the risk of eventual eminent domain conflicts.</p>
<p>In fact, the killer takes a moment to smile at the failed book store, understanding and appreciating not just its history but the history of the culture that created it, juxtaposed against the geographic location where they tried to build it. And not just at the current state of that location, but at the historical context of that specific coordinate dating back to before New York City was a gleam in a Dutchman&#39;s eye.</p>
<p>The whole book is filled with this stuff - Ellis writes a moment in time as just that, one of a vast number of moments experienced by his subject over its entire history. Nothing happens in a vacuum, everything is filled with history, with context - and if you can train yourself to see a thing&#39;s history when you look at it, to see with a super-imposed fourth dimension, then you find yourself experiencing the world in a very new way.</p>
<p>This understanding makes the villain much more interesting, because he does in fact live exactly in this way and it&#39;s the source of his power - but I don&#39;t want to get into spoilers.</p>
<p>Basically, you should go read this book. It&#39;s great, it&#39;s not very long, and it rewards scrutiny. I loved it.</p>

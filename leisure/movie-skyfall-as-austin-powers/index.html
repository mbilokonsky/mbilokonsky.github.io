Spoilers to follow if you haven&#39;t seen it, but hear me out.</p>

<p>The bulk of the criticisms I&#39;ve heard about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/">Skyfall</a> revolve around the idea that it&#39;s not sure if it&#39;s a serious spy movie or a campy action movie. If we&#39;re meant to take seriously the idea that undercover agents are at risk of being exposed to militant groups and summarily murdered on youtube, then isn&#39;t it a bit hard to accept the fact that James Bond can take a sniper shot, a 300 foot fall and a tumultuous tear down a river before washing up safely in the arms of yet another disposable Bond girl?</p>
<p>This feels deeply weird and inconsistent, but I think it&#39;s intentional. The movie is encouraging a sense of cognitive dissonance, and it uses that to drive its plot. Immortal Murderer/Rapist James Bond and Judi Dench&#39;s M are holdovers from a sillier, campier entertainment paradigm and they simply don&#39;t work in today&#39;s world. This movie is about addressing that impedance mismatch head-on, dealing with it, and figuring out how to move forward.</p>
<p>The secret to the movie, I think, is that it&#39;s incredibly self-aware of the limitations of the James Bond franchise. The first two acts are filled with innumerable plot points where criticisms of Bond or criticisms of the agency he represents are just thinly veiled criticisms of the Bond movies in general.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bond himself is getting old - can he continue to do what he does, or is it really just better for everyone if he stops? Isn&#39;t this just stale at this point?</li>
<li>MI6 in general, and M in particular, is constantly berated as an anachronistic holdover from a simpler time. Does it even make sense anymore to take their nationalistic reductionism seriously, let alone use it to justify the extreme behavior Bond and his cohorts indulge in?</li>
<li>The sheer mindless violence, is this movie a tragedy or a cartoon? The opening sequence has Bond willfully leaving a wounded colleague behind to die, on orders from M, then destroying a staggering amount of private property before being shot by his own partner, again on orders from M.</li>
<li>And dear god, the treatment of women and the depraved ultra-masculine authority we&#39;re all expected to just accept. The world has moved on, right? Don&#39;t even get me started on that creepy-as-fuck boat shower scene, or the fate of the poor girl he walks in on.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the movie makes all of these points for us. It&#39;s excited about how clever we are with our critical sensibilities and our awareness of privilege and our contempt for rape culture. It anticipates all of these weaknesses, and the genius of the writing is that these weaknesses of the franchise are embraced and turned into explicit weaknesses of Bond, M and their agency in the film. The villain, who understands these problems all too well, is easily able to wreak havoc over MI6 for two entire acts just by blurring a few lines which MI6 prefers to pretend are clearly defined.</p>
<p>So the clear message of the first two acts is that hey, there&#39;s really no more room for James Bond, M or the franchise&#39;s vision of MI-6 in a contemporary world. Hell, they don&#39;t even do fancy gadgets anymore - that stuff is a bit camp, isn&#39;t it? We&#39;re living in a Very Serious World with Very Real Problems and etc etc etc. Basically, the more Bond tries to Bond his way around in 21st century London the more he looks like Austin Powers.</p>
<p>Which is why, in the outrageously contrived runup to the film&#39;s final act, Bond grabs M and gets into a time machine. As they drive north in Roger Moore&#39;s ejection-seat-equipped Aston Martin they&#39;re also driving back to a simpler time. No gadgets from Q? No problem, they can make their own with loose floor boards and shot gun shells. A nuanced world with no clear villains or heroes? No problem, they isolate themselves in a perfect us-vs-them fantasy setting. And when the shooting starts - and it really, really starts - there&#39;s no civilian property around to be damaged by the unfathomable amount of firepower that&#39;s deployed. There&#39;s only Bond&#39;s personal origin, a crumbling estate that has not aged very well and is all too happy to accommodate all the damage the ensuing firefight has to offer. Metaphor much?</p>
<p>Bond wins this movie by acknowledging that his identity doesn&#39;t work in a contemporary setting, but instead of changing his identity he changes his setting. It&#39;s clever - it&#39;s magick, a bit, and like all magick it incurs a cost: M dies, because M had to die. Judi Dench was the last holdover from the previous Bond movies, and this was clearly meant to be a transitional piece. Without Judi Dench as M, the Bond franchise can move into a new future where it&#39;s free to reinvent itself along any axis that makes sense.</p>
<p>And so the movie ends with Bond back in London, his past utterly demolished and abandoned, ready for whatever the new day brings. Not a bad way to deal with 50 years of cultural baggage, if you ask me.</p>

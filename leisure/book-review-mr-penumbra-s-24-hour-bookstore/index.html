Overall I really enjoyed it - it was a creative romp through time and space, technology and typography. It had one major flaw, in my opinion - I hated the protagonist. But I&#39;ll get to that.</p>
<p>This is the book for you if your first reaction to stories about wide-ranging adventure-filled quests to unearth ancient secrets is &#39;huh, with the right google-fu you could have done most of this in your living room.&#39;</p>

<p>This is the first novel I&#39;ve read that&#39;s actively set within the San Francisco Tech Scene circa Right Now. Characters work at Google and ILM, problems are solved with Hadoop and Mechanical Turk, and a page is spent praising the elegance of Ruby (in contrast to the brutality of C, naturally).</p>
<p>There are a few scenes set on the Google campus and the author does a great job of making you really want to go work for Google. I&#39;m not sure how accurate the presentation of that reality is - I&#39;ve heard mixed things through the grape vine about what it&#39;s like to work for Google these days - but this is clearly a novel that is of and about the Present.</p>
<p>Which is kind of neat, because the plot is about the past.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a basic summary: protagonist gets a job at a bookstore. This bookstore is weird, has a lot of unique books which seem to contain gibberish. Doesn&#39;t sell many books, but has a small and regular clientelle that comes in to borrow the gibberish books.</p>
<p>Protagonist and his friends get curious about what the hell is going on with that. A bit of investigation, a bit of skulduggery and a casual application of Hadoop later, they uncover some sort of Ancient Conspiracy. Various questions are answered, more questions are asked, there&#39;s a big confrontation and, eventually, the truth comes out.</p>
<p>This was a fun read, and if you are hip to the tech scene and have a soft spot for historical capers then you&#39;ll feel like this was written for you - it probably was.</p>
<p>But I have a major gripe with the way this story is presented. There&#39;s a thirst here for meaningful insight into the meaning and nature of life - but this thirst characterizes various background characters. Significant problems are solved using Hadoop and Mechanical Turk, two really cool tools - but they&#39;re solved by the protagonist&#39;s girlfriend. Clever special effects are created to assist in a caper - by the protagonist&#39;s roommate. Brilliant code is written in an attempt to decrypt some information - by minor characters at various points. But what does our protagonist himself actually do?</p>
<p>Mostly he sits around and watches everyone else in his life perform these acts of magic. He&#39;s duly impressed and at least has the good grace from time to time to be embarrassed at his own lack of utility. He&#39;s a caricature of a specific archetype - the dude with the half-baked ideas for marketing something, who is totally going to finish learning Ruby this year, not like the last two years, who has never really built anything and lacks the passion to ever really do anything on his own. It&#39;s the slow, implicit nihilism of the chronically incompetent, the perpetual beginner, so devoted to nothing that even this devotion is shy and slow to reveal itself.</p>
<p>This assessment is uncharitable. It probably says more about me than it does about the book, and I doubt many people would find the protagonist as irritating as I do. If you want a fast read that takes you from the Google cafeteria to the print shops of 16th century Venice, this book is a lot of fun. And the payoff at the end is pretty good, though you won&#39;t find a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow.</p>
<p>Just, you know, don&#39;t model your life on Clay because god, what a loser. Argh.</p>

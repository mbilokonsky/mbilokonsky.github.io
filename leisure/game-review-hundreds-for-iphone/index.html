<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/hundreds/id493536432">Hundreds</a> is exactly that game.</p>

<p>The premise of this game is simple: there are some floating balls on the screen. When you touch one, it grows. As it grows it gets bigger, and its numerical value increases.</p>
<p>To win a level in this game, you just have to make sure that the total of all balls reaches 100.</p>
<p>The only catch is, when a ball is growing it turns red. If it touches any other ball while it&#39;s red, you lose.</p>
<p>Get it? So the closer you get to 100, the larger the total volume of your balls becomes, the harder it becomes to grow them without bumping them while you do it.</p>
<p>As you advance, additional types of objects appear. A saw blade will reduce any ball it comes into contact with to 0, immediately. Bubbles move around and cause you grief if you touch them while red, but can also be helpful buffers to keep other balls isolated. Balls connected via a dotted line can only be grown if you touch both of them at once.</p>
<p>This is great. It&#39;s a really excellent piece of work from <a href="http://www.semisecretsoftware.com/">Semi Secret</a>, the guys who brought you <a href="http://www.canabalt.com/">Canabalt</a></p>
<p>Go buy it, you won&#39;t regret it! :)</p>

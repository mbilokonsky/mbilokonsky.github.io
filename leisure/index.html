</div><ul><li><a href="/leisure/movie-beasts-of-the-southern-wild">Movie: Beasts of the Southern Wild</a><span>- <p>Some thoughts about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125435/">Beasts of the Southern Wild</a>.</span></li><li><a href="/leisure/movie-skyfall-as-austin-powers">Movie: Skyfall as Austin Powers</a><span>- <p>I finally figured out why I enjoyed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/">Skyfall</a> more than any of the other Bond movies. Spoilers to follow if you haven&#39;t seen it, but hear me out.</p></span></li><li><a href="/leisure/book-review-mr-penumbra-s-24-hour-bookstore">Book Review: Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore</a><span>- <p>I just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-ebook/dp/B008FPOIT6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357263186&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=mr+penumbra%27s+24-hour+bookstore">Mr. Penumbra&#39;s 24-hour Bookstore</a> by Robin Sloane. Overall I really enjoyed it - it was a creative romp through time and space, technology and typography. It had one major flaw, in my opinion - I hated the protagonist. But I&#39;ll get to that.</p>
<p>This is the book for you if your first reaction to stories about wide-ranging adventure-filled quests to unearth ancient secrets is &#39;huh, with the right google-fu you could have done most of this in your living room.&#39;</p></span></li><li><a href="/leisure/book-review-pirate-cinema">Book Review: Pirate Cinema</a><span>- <p>Part of me really liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pirate-Cinema-ebook/dp/B0089LOEBS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357264708&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Pirate+Cinema">Pirate Cinema</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a>, but part of me found it really infurating. There&#39;s a split here - this novel is actually two separate documents glued together with some interesting courtroom drama and political maneuvering. I liked the first document, which is an adventure story. I liked the glue. But I felt that the second drama was a straw man so egregious that it does a lot more harm than good to the cause it&#39;s meant to support.</p></span></li><li><a href="/leisure/game-review-hundreds-for-iphone">Game Review: Hundreds for iPhone</a><span>- <p>Puzzle games are always really hit or miss for me - a good puzzle game has to be simple enough that I can understand its primitives easily, but complex enough that I can come back again and again to plumb new emergent depths.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/hundreds/id493536432">Hundreds</a> is exactly that game.</p></span></li><li><a href="/leisure/book-review-gun-machine-by-warren-ellis">Book Review: Gun Machine by Warren Ellis</a><span>- <p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/warrnellis">Warren Ellis&#39;s</a> new novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gun-Machine-Warren-Ellis/dp/0316187402">Gun Machine</a>, is about NYPD detective John Tallow who accidentally stumbles upon evidence of a serial killer so dangerous and so prolific that capturing him would close dozens of unsolved cases.</p>
<p>On the surface, this is a tale about office politics in a police department where everyone is just angry at the additional paperwork. Digging a bit deeper you find the story of a lonely guy trying - trying really hard, and for the first time in years - to stop living exclusively in his head, to give a shit about other people. And if you really pay attention, you&#39;ll find that the value of this work - the real genius - has very little to do with the actual plot.</p>
<p>Warren Ellis&#39;s genius lies in the way he writes about time.</p></span></li></ul><div id="footer"><p>copyright<a href="http://twitter.com/mykola">@mykola</a><span>- Mon Apr 25 2016 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)</span></p></div></body></html>

There&#39;s a split here - this novel is actually two separate documents glued together with some interesting courtroom drama and political maneuvering. I liked the first document, which is an adventure story. I liked the glue. But I felt that the second drama was a straw man so egregious that it does a lot more harm than good to the cause it&#39;s meant to support.</p>

<p>The first component of this novel is a near-future adventure story about a 16 year old kid who runs afoul of the law, causes big trouble for his family and decides to run away to the big city to make it on his own. He makes friends with a ragtag group of streetwise supporting characters and spends his days learning how to eat well out of dumpsters, squat in a reasonably nice place quasi-legally and ultimately come to terms with his identity and his responsibility to himself, his family and his society.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a nice love story, some cool characters and some sci-fi around the technology in use that comes right from the author&#39;s fantastic insights about <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/12/27/the-coming-war-on-general-purp.html">The Coming War on General Purpose Computing</a>. He does a great job exploring how this sort of tech can and will shape public usage of computers, and also exploring how little sense that makes in some very real ways.</p>
<p>And this first document is fun! I liked it a lot, I really cared about how things worked out for the starving artist protagonist and his group of friends. The novel ends with a really exciting and daring act of public protest (though I&#39;m still not sure how the audio was supposed to work in that scene - did I miss something?) and the whole thing weaves in and out of the second document, discussed below, using legal and political activities as glue. This is well done and interesting.</p>
<p>But the second document is a self-righteous screed against the idea of intellectual property. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong: I absolutely agree with Mr. Doctorow that publishers have WAY too much legal power, that our copyright system is clearly running amok and stifling creativity instead of protecting it, that draconian laws attempting to eliminate filesharing are completely batshit insane, etc.</p>
<p>But in the world of Pirate Cinema, the only people who pirate movies are remix artists who just want to, like, create art, man. And they totally don&#39;t mind if you, like, share their art, because <em>information wants to be free</em>, man!</p>
<p>And look: I can totally sympathize with this attitude, and I think sharing videos and music is great, and I love open-source software. I use it every day. But I also love closed-source software, which I write for a living. My company couldn&#39;t do what it&#39;s doing if every day I committed my updates to a public github repo.</p>
<p>Similarly, Hollywood studios couldn&#39;t fund the movies they make if, after writing and rewriting and casting and directing and shooting and editing and reshooting and reediting and producing and marketing etc etc etc their final product was a digital file that they gave away for free. This is just true - it takes a lot of work to make movies, even if the final product is &#39;totally hollywood&#39; and lacks any spark of human artistic expression. Which it doesn&#39;t - even the worst movie might have an inspired line of dialog, a great shot, a brilliant piece of editing, etc.</p>
<p>These things are expensive to make and if I spent my work days making them I&#39;d expect to get paid. Does that make me less of an artist? Does working on a proprietary codebase make me less of a programmer?</p>
<p>I completely agree that the media publishers are making a mockery of everything when they sue teenagers for millions for pirating songs or movies, and I think it&#39;s insane to send anyone to jail over such offenses. Clearly some compromises must be reached, and it&#39;s not at all clear that the best way to solve these problems is to let the publishers write our laws, which is essentially what&#39;s happening now.</p>
<p>But honestly, are we going to solve that problem by refusing to acknowledge that intellectual property has value?</p>
<p>Who do we help if we put our fingers in our ears and insist that the conflict is between Greedy Industry People and Ragtag Starving Artists Forced to Live on the Streets To Make Their Art Because They Can&#39;t Afford Licensing Fees?</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#39;s my two cents.</p>

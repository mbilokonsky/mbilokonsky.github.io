<p>We watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125435/">Beasts of the Southern Wild</a>, and honestly I&#39;ve never seen anything else like it. It&#39;s set beyond the levee (so this is New Orleans, in the future?) in a flood-ravaged community called The Bathtub. People here are poor, but generally happy. There&#39;s a girl named Hush Puppy. She goes to school, lives with her dad. Her dad is sick, but he&#39;s doing his best. There&#39;s a storm. Life is hard. There&#39;s an encounter with Civilization. She perserveres. Life shows no sign of getting any easier. The movie ends.</p>
<p>This is sort of a dystopian-science-fiction-meets-medieval-fantasy setting. They live in a village, they catch their own food, they know each other by name and every day is a holiday of some sort. They all know that one day a storm is going to come and wash away their little town. We&#39;re informed of this fact by Hush Puppy, who is six years old.</p>
<p>The movie is interspersed with scenes of aurochs - great prehistoric beasts, who hold a special significance for Hush Puppy - thawing out of the ice and beginning to run. As the movie progresses, as Hush Puppy lives her life and faces her trials, we keep cutting back to them running, faster and faster, with no mercy, crushing everything before them. In a significant moment they catch up to Hush Puppy, and bow before her.</p>
<p>This is a movie about how life is always hard, and we have the choice to trample life or be trampled by it.</p>
<p>Clearly I&#39;m having a hard time articulating my thoughts clearly, maybe I still need to digest this more - but you should see this movie. It feels new to me, a new kind of science fiction. It&#39;s the first future-american mythology I&#39;ve ever seen that actually feels real, and honest, and terrifying for all that.</p>
